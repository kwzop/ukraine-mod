putin_mission.2.desc:0 "The fervent aspirations of the Motherland have encountered an unexpected hurdle. Despite resolute efforts, the Special Military Operation (SMO) ambitious goal of swiftly subduing Ukraine has faltered. Ukrainian resistance proves fiercer than expected, drawing out the conflict past the intended month-long timeline. Reports from the frontlines highlight the stubborn resolve of Ukrainian forces, revealing miscalculations in their determination. Battles rage, consuming valuable time and resources as the deadline nears. This failure prompts strategy recalibration, a reevaluation of strengths, and the need for a new approach. Amidst discussions in the Kremlin, the fate of the Motherland's ambitions hangs in the balance. Will this setback delay victory or lead to greater challenges? Russian resilience will shape the outcome. History is written in adversity's crucible. As days unfold, the world watches, wondering if the Motherland can rise stronger from this stumble. The ministry of defence suggests these measures."

dnr.2.t: "Death of Vladimir Zhoga"
dnr.2.desc: "It became known about the death of colonel Vladimir Artemovich Zhogi, commander of a separate intelligence battalion "Sparta". Vladimir has been with us from very beginning of our struggle for the liberation of Donbass. He managed to take part in the battles for Donetsk airport, Slavyansk, Shakhtersk and Snazhny, received many wounds, but even then he always showed himself as a real fighter, able to protect his comrades and return to the ranks again. After the start of the war with Kiev regime, Zhoga was one of the foremost fighters of our army. But the vile Nazis shot him near Volnovakha, at a time when he was evacuating civilians. The farewell to the deceased hero of Donbass is planned to be held at the Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theater. The Russian leadership also promised to reward Vladimir deservedly as a true defender of the Russian world."

Igor Ivanovich led our troops from the beginning of the fight against the Kiev neo-Nazi regime, and repeatedly proved his dedication to the idea of the liberation of Donbass in battles. But after the end of his tenure as Minister of Defence of the Donetsk People's Republic, he left the country. Although he was living in Moscow, he had repeatedly criticised the current military capabilities of the DPR and LPR, and Russia's policy towards Ukraine. Although Girkin is a veteran and a very experienced commander, he is primarily a traitor to his homeland, who has not returned to Donbass for 8 years and lives quietly in Russia. So what do we do with him?" 
dnr.3.a: "It can be very useful"

rus.8.t: "Starting situation"
rus.8.desc: "The Russian invasion of Ukraine is approaching. The background of the impending conflict began as early as 2013, when anti-Russian protests began throughout the country, the consequence of which in early 2014 was the proclamation of the DPR and LPR, which turned into a full-fledged war in eastern Ukraine. Active hostilities continued until 2015, although local skirmishes between the troops took place until 2022. On the one side of the conflict is Russia, which wants to get an industrially developed and densely populated Donbass, as well as protect the Russians living in the Republics. On the other side of the conflict is Ukraine, which wants to restore control over the rebellious lands. What will the coming year bring us?"
rus.8.a: "The year promises to be interesting"
rus.9.t: "Recognition of the LDPR"
rus.9.desc: "Today, President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognizing the independence of the DPR and the LPR.

From now on, the Russian Federation will officially begin to supply humanitarian and military aid to the People's Republics, and under the agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance of Russia with the DPR and LPR, Russia has every right to launch an invasion of Ukraine to ensure the protection and territorial integrity of the republics of Donbass."
rus.9.a: "Donbass will be free!"
smo.1.t: "NATO Expansion"
smo.1.desc: "Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO have long been obvious. If we allow this, NATO will get a large border with Russia, and the independence of our allies - Lugansk and Donetsk - will also inevitably be eliminated.

smo.2.t: "Escalation"
smo.2.desc: "An imminent escalation of the conflict is coming, to this day the conflict in Ukraine is a hybrid war, and recently there has been almost no fighting. But in mid-December, Russia put forward demands for the termination of support for Ukraine and attempts to include it in the alliance. These demands were considered impossible by NATO, and then they began to support Ukraine even more. In response to this, we can hold negotiations and try to come to an agreement, although, in case of their failure, escalation cannot be avoided. But there is another, more radical way in which we will start a full-scale war with Ukraine. So, it remains to decide what we will choose?"

During them, a lot of shells and cartridges were transferred, some equipment broke down, because there is no non-breaking equipment, and it is unlikely that there will ever be. But all this is recoverable, the shells will be produced by factories, the equipment will be repaired. The most important thing is that these exercises have strengthened the ties between our fraternal countries and peoples, increased the professionalism of the army, prepared it for future difficulties… \nAgree, it sounds like everything is fine and this is a happy ending? Oh, if only it were so… \nThe exercises are over, the journalists are leaving for other places in search of new materials for news, the troops are being transferred back to the barracks, leaving for their usual places of deployment.

Our valiant fighters will soon march through the square of "Independence". Although we did not expect such resistance from the Nazis, which caused the city to be pretty battered, but we achieved our goal! Now, our priority is to restore stability and order in the city, as well as to identify active accomplices of the neo-Nazi regime. President Zelensky, along with his office and the supreme military command, was evacuated shortly before our troops reached Bankova Street.

After all, today is a historical date - Nazism in Ukraine has officially been defeated. Since the Ukrainian government has agreed to our demands. Russia returned its historical lands to its native harbor, and also protected the residents of Donbass from neo-Nazis who intimidated ordinary people.

We really hope that we will be able to find a common language with the West, and the negotiations will bear fruit."

rus.22.b: "We will demand negotiations on the Ukrainian issue"
rus.29.t: "Negotiations have reached an impasse"
rus.29.desc: "Obviously, it was pointless to hope for something better, especially on the part of NATO. We offered the West a compromise solution that would be beneficial to both us and them, but the NATO administration and the United States did not even listen to us.\n This once again confirms the intention of the Western countries to resist our influence in the post-Soviet space, to resist the Russian-speaking population, to literally pit two fraternal peoples against each other for their own benefit. Historically, Europe has always taken up arms against us, declaring its exclusivity, as it was in the days of Napoleon and Hitler, the same thing is happening now.\n Now that the true nature of the West has become clear to us, we have no choice but to continue to pull our armed forces to the Ukrainian border. The ongoing crisis between our states is likely to soon result in a bloody and merciless confrontation…"
rus.29.a: "Coming soon…"
rus.24.t: "NATO is ready to make concessions"
rus.24.desc: "Not to say that everyone is surprised is to say nothing. Our Russian diplomacy has shown another example of world history when conflicts can be solved not by the power of cannon caliber, but by the power of words, wisdom and perseverance shown by our people in the Foreign Ministry.\n The administration agreed to make a number of concessions, including in terms of Ukraine joining their alliance. Of course, not all the points of Putin's "Ultimatum" were fulfilled, but the basis for future full-fledged negotiations was laid. \n However, you should not lose your vigilance yet. The people of Donbass are waiting for us to act and we will take all necessary measures. But we managed to prevent a large-scale conflict that would have destroyed tens of thousands of lives, and this will be the best example for future generations."

However, not everyone is happy with the sharp increase in the influence of the Wagner group and the successes of those close to §RPrigozhin§!. The current Minister of Defense expresses his dissatisfaction §2Sergey Shoigu§! and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation §2Valeriy Gerasimov§!.

Of course, it is not without censure, especially from the side of §RPrigozhin§! and his §R"PMC "Wagner§!. But is it necessary to take into account their opinions if their military influence in the SVO has hopelessly dried up, practically displacing them from the scene of the Russian command?"
rus.31.o: "The upstart was overboard. The army knows its business."
rus.32.t: "Igor Girkin joins the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"

We are talking about Igor Ivanovich Girkin (Strelkov), who will be subordinated directly to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation from the generals of the NM DNR. Girkin is a veteran of various military operations, ranging from the Chechen wars and the Bosnian Volunteer Corps, ending with the very beginning of the conflict in the Donbas. Including on his shoulders the merit of retaining significant territories and cities of Donbass for a long time from Ukrainian aggression back in 2014. Also, he served as the Minister of Defense of the DPR at the beginning of the formation of the republic, but was suspended and returned to Russia. With the beginning of the SVO, Igor Ivanovich again showed a desire and interest to return to the ranks of the Donbass militia first, and now directly to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

rus.33.t: "The SMO went according to plan"
rus.33.d: "It has been several months since the start of the Special Military Operation, but we have not even liberated the territories that we planned to quickly seize from the Kiev neo-Nazis. The whole world laughs that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation cannot walk several kilometers in Ukraine. These events are increasingly suppressing the desire of our fighters to fight, and the people have long demanded decisive action from us. The generals' opinions on this matter are divided, some believe that it is necessary to stop attacking the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and wait for their counteroffensive, destroy the best troops of Ukraine in it and resume their attacks. Others insist on the continuation of offensive actions, and still others demand the termination of a SMO altogether."

A criminal case has been initiated against the girl under Article 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Ukraine denies its involvement in this terrible event."

A man with Nazi symbols on his clothes and two traumatic pistols converted for firing live ammunition burst into the 88 school of Izhevsk. It is reported about 19 dead (including the attacker) and 23 wounded. The shooter himself, 34-year-old Artem Kazantsev, committed suicide before the police arrived.\n Every year there are more and more similar cases, and this trend is starting to scare. Against this background, the discussion about the restriction of the sale of weapons and the introduction of additional security measures in educational institutions has begun again in society, but it usually does not go beyond these words.

Against this background, Putin demanded from us "security guarantees" for the Russian Federation, that is, a complete rejection of our military bases in Eastern Europe, as well as a ban on Georgia and Ukraine joining NATO.

The targets were both military and civilian infrastructure, mainly allocated for electricity and heat supply - CHP plants, transformers, power lines. The public is also excited by the fact that not a single large settlement on the territory of Ukraine escaped from the attack - the city of Sumy located near the border, as well as the capital Kiev and distant Lviv were hit. The command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the population protected by it in confusion and fear - if such attacks continue and are frequent, the energy infrastructure will not have time to recover, which will lead both to the impossibility of proper nutrition of the front, and to the decline of the whole country and society as a whole, as a result of the impossibility of continuing industrial production and the collapse of the highly qualified service sector, the cessation of heating and the supply of light, and as a consequence of all this - to hunger, unemployment, large-scale pestilence and the complete collapse of the unified state administration."

In 1992, our country declared independence from Moldova, many did not think that we would be able to withstand the onslaught of Moldovan troops, but volunteers from the Russian Federation arrived in time, who established the current borders, and also helped to freeze the conflict. For 2022, our country is one of the most backward in Europe, our actions are almost completely controlled by the Russian Federation, in return they give us protection. Our independence has been recognized by countries that are also unrecognized states, namely Abkhazia, South Ossetia and the NKR. Our leader is V.N. Krasnoselsky - he graduated with honors from a military school in Kharkiv, but he did not want to take the oath to independent Ukraine, so he fled to our republic.

news.49.d: "Since the beginning of October 2021, various media outlets have reported that the Russian Federation may be preparing an invasion of the territory of Ukraine, which caused a crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations, as well as the wariness of Western countries. As a result, this led to a series of diplomatic actions on the part of Russia and Western countries, as well as to initial negotiations, which, however, did not have any significant success. Russia was reluctant to act in the political space, and some of the demands looked like nothing more than an attempt to delay the negotiations, or disrupt them. However, unexpectedly for everyone, Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov proposed to convene a summit to discuss the conflict over Ukraine, calling on Western countries to «‎ensure justice» and «‎protect peace.». In response, the United States, Great Britain and Ukraine sent a note of consent to participate in this event, although it was not without speculative statements from both sides of the conflict. Many international and national media dubbed this event as an unexpected detente and the likely end of the crisis, but analysts urge not to rush to conclusions — given Russian rhetoric, as well as the ultimatum of Western countries about some points of Russia's early claims, the summit may have absolutely unpredictable consequences, and it is too early to talk about the end of the crisis."

And the reason for this is the urgent appeal of the President of the Russian Federation on the introduction of partial mobilization. As Vladimir Putin said in his address, Ukraine has shelled the territories of the LPR, the DPR, as well as the Russian-Ukrainian border, which is why he is forced to prepare "retaliatory measures" by starting partial mobilization and putting all kinds of troops on alert. The Ministry of Defense added that only people with combat experience, volunteers and specialists who have served in military police units are subject to partial mobilization. Judging by the data published by the Government of the Russian Federation, it is planned to put under arms about 100,000 people who will carry out police and security functions."

The irremovability of the rulers in the republic has made itself felt, all the state institutions of Chechnya are completely subordinated to Kadyrov personally, and the Kadyrov family itself has its own army of mercenaries. However, the Republic's economy is still completely dependent on the federal center, all cash flows are controlled by the Kremlin, and this whole game of Autonomy on the part of both the head of the Republic and the Russian Federation causes some concern. In addition, Chechnya has a number of problems, including corruption, human rights violations, religious and cultural discrimination.\n It is in this state of affairs that the unstable Chechen Republic approaches an equally unstable period of time.

He played a big role in the victory of the federal troops in the Second Chechen War. Becoming the first head of post-war Chechnya, he did a lot to restore peace in the republic.

The AFU hoped to gain a foothold on the river massif in the future and continue the defense, but the actions of the Russian special forces and the confusion of the Ukrainian soldiers brought these attempts to naught.

Meanwhile, the APU prepared for street battles and a long siege inside the Dnieper, and evacuated the remnants of the population.\nResidential areas in the south of the city were the first to suffer. Areas consisting exclusively of apartment buildings have become the main target of Russian artillery. Advancing in a barrage, Russian soldiers gradually occupied the devastated areas of the Dnieper. In the end, due to lack of supplies, the AFU had to leave the southern regions, undermine bridges across the Dnieper, and withdraw to its main fortress - the Dnieper Metallurgical Plant. The defenders of the city have been there for a long time.restrained the attacks of the Russian army.\nDue to its state of siege, heavy losses and the futility of further resistance, in the end, the last remnants of resistance in the city were suppressed.\nThe APU made attempts to counterattack and regain control of at least part of the Dnieper, but all their attempts were repulsed.\nNow the Russian military administration runs everything in the city.

This is not only an important strategic point. Along with neighboring Slavyansk, Kramatorsk is a major transport and military hub.\nIt took a long time for the Russian troops to push the AFU defensive lines so close to this city. Embracing the positions of the Ukrainian army from all sides, units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation occupied district after district with heavy blood. Eventually, Kramatorsk turned into ruins. The same as in the places of other cities of Donbass.\n According to experts, the loss of such an important defensive center may lead to a breakthrough of all AFU positions on the eastern front.

For a long time, the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not give the Russian army the opportunity to even enter Bahmut, let alone take it. But after the fall of small settlements on the flanks of the city, the Ukrainian army had to gradually give up positions in order not to be surrounded. Played into the hands and the actions of PMC "Wagner" in the area. In order to break through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the PMC launched endless waves of manpower, revealing the positions of the defenders and forcing them to suffer from exhaustion.\nFor a long time, the Ukrainian authorities emphasized that Bahmut would not be abandoned. Many free forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were transferred here, and it is not a fact that it is expedient.\nNevertheless, this is no longer important for Kyiv. What is left of the city, and this, according to Mayor Bahmut, is 40% of the development, is now controlled by Russia. And what this threatens for the entire grouping of the Ukrainian army in the Donbass is still unknown."

The Ukrainian soldiers were ordered to hold it in their hands by all means.\nDespite the valor of the defenders, the competent actions of the Russian army eventually broke the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\nAccording to experts, the loss of Pokrovsk threatens the failure of the entire Ukrainian defense in eastern Ukraine.

The second capital of the country, the city of Kharkiv, has fallen.\nFrom the very beginning of Moscow's invasion, Kharkiv became one of the main targets of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. It is located right on the border with Russia, and therefore it was not difficult for parts of the Russian army to quickly break through and encircle the city. His main district highway helped in this.\nFor a long time, the AFU managed to hold Russian units on the outskirts of Kharkov, but the brazen attacks of the special forces of the Russian Armed Forces that broke into the city forced them to move further away from their positions.\nThe first mass shelling occurred in the northern districts of Kharkiv. All of them were practically destroyed. The building of the Kharkiv Regional Administration was also damaged after the Kalibr missile strike. Almost everyone who was there died.\nAlready during the city battles, most of the residential buildings of Kharkov were destroyed. The surviving residents who did not have time to leave the city hid in the subway, there was no water or light in it.Due to the fact that Russia failed to immediately capture the city, it took a lot of time for its complete subordination and purification from the forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There are still reports of small pockets of resistance, but the last major battle was fought in the area of the University Hill. It is only known that almost all the fighters of the Ukrainian army died there.Only memories remain of the old Kharkov."

For a long time, parts of the Russian army could not even approach the city. Its hilly terrain made the position of the AFU almost impregnable, but even so, the Ukrainian army failed to contain the onslaught of the attackers.\nAlong with other cities of Donbass, Slavyansk was almost completely destroyed.

But unfortunately for the AFU, the garrison of Seversk failed to contain the onslaught of the Russian army.\nIn general, the city managed to survive. But there were practically no living people left in it - all were either evacuated by the Ukrainian authorities even before the arrival of the Russians. For Kiev, this is not the main thing.

During the assault on Ugledar, many tactical mistakes were made. Forming columns, attacking in an open area… All this caused huge losses among the units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and became a real test of Russian soldiers.\nBut even so, the Ukrainian army failed to hold off the onslaught of superior forces.

Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the AFU managed to contain the attacking forces. And even during the war, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and others could not take the city. Instead, Avdiivka was shelled for a long time with various weapons: phosphorous and thermobaric ammunition, rockets and simple artillery shells.\nBut the Russian army still decided to finally take over the city. After a long assault on Avdiivka, the APU finally abandoned their positions under the threat of encirclement. Thus, they left one of the centers of the AFU defensive line in the Donbas.\nExperts argue about the expediency of the battle for Avdiivka. The forces that were spent on breaking through the lines of the Ukrainian army and bombing the city are clearly not equivalent to what was received. But the fact is that Avdiivka is now under Russian control."

But the unfortunate location of the city made it an easy target for the Russians advancing from the south.\nUnder the threat of complete encirclement, Ukrainian units sadly left the city. They retreated to more advantageous positions, but promised to return without fail.\nLisichansk, unlike other cities of Donbass, was lucky. Now most of the city remains intact. Despite this, there is a clear shortage of essential goods, and periodically there is no light and water. Most of the residents of Lisichansk left the city before the arrival of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, and those who remained faced a serious humanitarian crisis."

After the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fierce clashes between the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Armed Forces of Ukraine took place in the Maryinka area, as a result of which the city was completely destroyed. However, now the city is controlled by the troops of the Russian Federation, who march along Druzhby Avenue, the main street of the city. Probably, Maryinka will become a convenient supply hub for the troops of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the NM of the DPR, and the APU thus lost an important supply point.
